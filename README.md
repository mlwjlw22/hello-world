I am enjoying the amazing phase of life.  My daughter just graduated with her Masters and will be getting married in Ocotber.  I have an amazing job that I enjoy and I am always learning something new.  I got my bachelors degree late and life and never thought I would go on to get my masters but **here I am**!!
